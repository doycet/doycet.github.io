<p><i>Trump reorganized the National Security Council to, along with other changes, give Bannon a regular seat on the principals committee — the meetings of the most senior national security officials, including the secretaries of defense and state.</i></p>
<p><i>That memo also states that the director of national intelligence and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff will sit on the principals committee only when the issues to be discussed pertain to their “responsibilities and expertise.”</i></p>
<p>Yeah why would you need the director of national intelligence sitting on the National Security Council. Waste of time. Clearly.</p>
