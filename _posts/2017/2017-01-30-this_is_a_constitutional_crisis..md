<p>The Dulles airport CBP continues to hold detainees without access to lawyers, deporting two, both in defiance of specific federal court order.</p>

<p>If the CBP continues a refusal of unambiguous Federal court orders, then this is serious, serious beyond the scale of anything we&rsquo;ve seen in our lifetimes: it&rsquo;s the Department of Homeland Security saying that if Trump tells them to do one thing and the courts another, they will do what Trump says and best of luck to the courts trying to enforce that. Which is to say, <strong>they&rsquo;re establishing a precedent that DHS actions are not subject to any sort of court review, or to anything other than the personal fiat of Trump â€“ including their right to detain people, deport them, or hold them incommunicado.</strong></p>

<p>And the Trump Administration removed the link for The Judicial branch of the federal government off the White House website.</p>

<p>This is a constitutional crisis.</p>
