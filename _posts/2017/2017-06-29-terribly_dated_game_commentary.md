<p>After having the core D&amp;D fifth edition books on my shelf for <del>well over a year</del> almost three years, I finally had good cause to read them. (I&#39;m a bit past the point where I can find the time to read RPGs just for the heck of it.)</p>
<p>I&#39;m both surprised and delighted to discover how little of the Player&#39;s Handbook and Dungeon Master&#39;s Guide are actually <i>rules for play</i>: the (300 page) PHB&#39;s rules section is about 25 pages (with 175 for character creation, and 100 for magic-related stuff), and the DMG&#39;s section is roughly 30 pages, with the other 90% almost entirely devoted to world-building guidelines, advice, or examples of once kind or another (with optional rules from older editions of the game scattered throughout, allowing you to easily customize/homerule the system to whatever flavor of DnD you like best. Potion miscibility tables!)</p>
<p>It&#39;s weird to say 600 total pages of rulebooks represent a lean, simple system, but it really does. Good game.</p>
