<p>In the early 1930s, the German Nationalist Party (read: Nazis) didn&rsquo;t start out with concentration camps; they started out with new employment laws.</p>
<p>Well, there was a progression. First, no new immigrants of certain types (Jews, Romani, etc.). </p>
<p>Then, new employment laws aimed at &lsquo;undesirables&rsquo; (previous list, plus Gays) who were already in the country (and in many cases had been for generations), making it illegal or very difficult to hire/employ them.</p>
<p>Stop me if this sounds familiar.</p>
<p>So then: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a real shame what happened to our Jewish neighbors, but HEY Heinrich, maybe now you can apply for that promotion…&rdquo;</p>
<p>You know what made me think of this?</p>
<p>A (very) liberal guy in my feed who shared this article with the comment &ldquo;Actually, as an engineer, I kind of support this…&rdquo;</p>
