<p>Had a fun evening that ran a little later than expected, doing something I haven&#8217;t done in a long time.</p>
<p>Or ever, depending on how you look at it.</p>
<p>I did a group dungeon run in an MMO. Haven&#8217;t done that in a long time.</p>
<p>I did it with two of my kids, so&#8230; yeah. That&#8217;s new.</p>
<p>The vehicle for this bit of virtual heroics was a perennial game around our house: Pirate 101.</p>
<p>Now, we&#8217;ve been playing stuff from Kingsisle Entertainment for quite some time &#8211; <a href="http://randomaverage.com/index.php/2010/04/my-daughter-the-wizard/">Kaylee played Wizard 101 for the first time back in 2010</a>, before she turned five. The game&#8217;s in-house popularity comes and goes (personally, I enjoy it, and there&#8217;s enough going on with the pop-culture jokes, storyline, and card-building combat system that I don&#8217;t get bored), but it&#8217;s installed on our machines far more than not (and it runs on everything but the tablets and chromebooks, which is nice).</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, Kaylee started making noises about how she missed playing Pirate101, which shares the same basic setting as Wizard101, but with different classes, and more tactical, turn- and grid-based combat system (sort of a big-pixel version of X-Com combat, with cool animations when it plays out), and I was getting a leeeeettle tired of Sean&#8217;s obsession with Overwatch, so I stuck both Wizard 101 and Pirate 101 back on, and let the kids go to town.</p>

<p>Sean enjoyed watching his sister rock the Pirate thing, but spent most of his own play time as Sean Bearhammer, young wizard.</p>
<p>&#8230;until a few days ago, when he decided he wanted to try out the Pirate side of the Spiral &#8211; where there&#8217;s a bit more action in combat, and EVERYONE has a crew of cool anthropomorphic animals fighting on your side. Yeah. Hard to see why THAT was a draw.</p>
<p>It took him a few days to really figure out the combat system (and I have to force myself not to watch him play, because he make <em>sub optimal choices GAHHHhhhh&#8230;</em>), but by yesterday he was caught up to where Kaylee and I had gotten on our main guys, if not just a bit ahead.</p>
<p>So, in lieu of regular bedtime activities, we teamed up (Sean as his combat-heavy Buccaneer, Kaylee as her magic-hurling Witchdoctor, and me playing a sort of support &amp; tactics Privateer) and headed to a (if not THE) lost city of gold, where we fought a lot of dinosaurian bad guys and, a BIT too late into the evening, decided to take down the final dungeon.</p>
<p>So&#8230; yeah. That was the evening &#8211; dungeon raiding with my kids for sweet loot and new skills.</p>
<p>It was pretty great.</p>
