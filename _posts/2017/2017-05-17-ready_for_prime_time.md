<p>Last night, we started a new Dungeon World game with the regular Tuesday night group. As I shared yesterday, I&#39;ve been pretty excited about the game, as have the players, and it went about as well as I&#39;d hoped.</p>
<p>But that&#39;s not what I&#39;m posting about.</p>
<p>Normally, <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/115858100139664016432" oid="115858100139664016432">Kaylee Testerman</a></span> isn&#39;t around on Tuesday nights, but she was last night, and in lieu of doing some Overwatch matches with her (which is what normally happens if she&#39;s around and has no homework), I asked if she wanted to join the game.</p>
<p>She did.</p>
<p>Now, Kaylee&#39;s played quite a few RPGs with me, her cousins, and even with Sean, but she&#39;s never joined in on a &#39;regular&#39; play group, and after I asked and she said she was in, I had a few niggling worries because&#8230; come on: she&#39;s eleven. She didn&#39;t even know two of the guys in the group. What if she ending up being the &quot;super annoying kid of the GM?&quot;</p>
<p>I may be (probably am) biased, but really I needn&#39;t have worried. She was focused, polite, thoughtful, inventive, and just all around a positive contributing member of the game &#8211; I was particularly impressed with her answer to the question I asked each player: &quot;This land is beautiful/desolate, because&#8230;&quot; (here: <a href="https://youtu.be/ML-LUfjNgas?t=1h10m26s" class="ot-anchor">https://youtu.be/ML-LUfjNgas?t=1h10m26s</a>), but all of her play showed so much thought, I worried people would think I&#39;d coached her. </p>
<p>(She told me after that game that during the owlbear fight, she&#39;d been googling &quot;how to take down big monsters in fantasy games&quot; so she&#39;d have a good action to take when it was her turn.)</p>
<p>Nerd-gamer-me was proud as could be.</p>
