<p>(So&#8230; I made the mistake of clicking on Google Drive while editing a g+ post, and lost a meaty actual play and an hour of my life, because fuck-you, Google+, you joy-stealing bundle of 20% hacks.)</p>
<p>So, short version: despite planning on <i>Masks</i> (and making up a team of four cool heroes with the girls, my son, and wife), my oldest daughter and niece ended up <i>actually</i> playing <b>World of Dungeons: Breakers</b> during our vacation (since neither son nor wife could reliably participate), BUT due to my niece&#39;s unfamiliarity with the inspirational source media for Breakers, we stepped back from wacky Ghostbuster-style-dungeon-crawling, and went for a creepy horror game (niece&#39;s request) inspired by The Secret World MMO. (Start off by pretending the events in TSW make coherent narrative sense from start to finish &#8211; a conceit Breakers easily provides &#8211; and chuck everything that doesn&#39;t support that connecting tissue.)</p>
<p>It worked, it was cool, and we got to fight zombies, a wendigo, and barnacle-encrusted horrors from the unknown watery deeps.</p>
