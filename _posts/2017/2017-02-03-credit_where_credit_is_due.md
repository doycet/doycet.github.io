<p>My new normal includes calling my Reps and Senators about important issues every day, and making sure they know there are people out in the world who care about this stuff. Bit by bit, it&#39;s having an effect. [<a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/317379-gop-senator-to-vote-no-on-betsy-devos" class="ot-anchor">http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/317379-gop-senator-to-vote-no-on-betsy-devos</a>]</p>
<p>First on the list today was Mike Coffman, my rep. Now, Coffman&#39;s a Republican, and I&#39;m not, and honestly I&#39;m not expecting a lot of headway.</p>
<p>But.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the thing: Coffman <i>did</i> distance himself from Trump during the election &#8211; did say he wasn&#39;t voting for him, that Trump should withdraw, that he would hold Tan Dumplord accountable for his actions if he won.</p>
<p>And, so far, he has&#8230; kind of done that. [<a href="https://www.denverite.com/republican-rep-mike-coffmans-28334/" class="ot-anchor">https://www.denverite.com/republican-rep-mike-coffmans-28334/</a>] &#8211; It&#39;s a little weak, certainly open to interpretation, but it&#39;s there, and right now you take the wins you can get.</p>
<p>So, credit where it was due: I got a live person (wonder of wonders) and made sure to start off by commending Coffman on his statements regarding the Muslim Ban, and how glad I was to see him take that stand.</p>
<p>THEN I went into &quot;And since he&#39;s made such a <i>principled</i> stand on the Muslim Ban, let&#39;s talk about what he needs to say about the White Supremacist <i>civilian</i> who just replaced two experienced, core members of the National Security Council&#8230;&quot;</p>

Mike Coffman says he doesn&#8217;t support a travel ban based on religion. But how does he feel about Trump&#8217;s executive order? &#8211; Denverite</a><br />Update: The Denver Post caught up with Mike Coffman in D.C., and he had some stronger words. He called the executive order an &ldquo;embarrassment&rdquo; and said it was poorly thought out and poorly executed. Presumably this is a statement in response to President Donald Trump&rsquo;s executive order on refugees, but it doesn&rsquo;t actually refer to the order &hellip; Continue reading &#8220;Republican Rep.
