<p>White millenials voted for Trump 48% to 42%  <br>

White women voted for Trump 53% to 43%  <br>

White college graduates voted for Trump 49% to 45%</p>

<p>The problem isn’t babyboomers, men or ignorance. The problem is white supremacy.</p>

<p>The problem with this post is that it’s comparing whites to whites. Not blacks to blacks or blacks to whites. This is complete bull shit sorry</p>

<p>Black men voted Hillary 82% to 13%  <br>
Black women voted Hillary 94% to 4%</p>
<p>Latino men voted Hillary 63% to 32%  <br>
Latino women voted Hillary 69% to 25%</p>
<p>Black millenials voted Hillary 85% to 9%  <br>
Latinos millenials voted Hillary 68% to 26%</p>
<p>Non-whites college graduates voted Hillary 72% to 22%  <br>
 


All of these are from the same exit poll I used for my original post: <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/election/results/exit-polls/national/president" target="_blank">http://edition.cnn.com/election/results/exit-polls/national/president</a></p>
<p>It is hard to find a single white demographic that did not come up with a Trump majority (white college graduated women some up with a 51% for Hillary, a small margin indeed) and there is not a single non-white demographic that came up with a Trump majority or came anywhere near it.

<p>

I encourage you to look through those exit poll results for yourself. CNN has  extensive and well-researched exit polls and the difference in the numbers is far too big to be explained away by a margin of error.

<p><b>Statistically the strongest defining feature of the Trump supporter is whiteness. </b></p>
<p>Does this mean the majority of white people actively hate people of color and voted for Trump because they wanted a racist in charge? No. That’s not how white supremacy works. </p>
<p>What it does mean it that, as a result of white supremacy, a LOT of white people who consider themselves ‘not racist’, ignored Trump’s racism and voted for him anyway. <b>A lot of white people did not care about people of color enough to not vote for Trump. </b></p>
<p><b>That’s white surpemacy’s biggest feature: apathy to the point of allowing people to die because you can’t be bothered to keep them safe. </b></p>
