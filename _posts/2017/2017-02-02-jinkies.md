<p>In pretty much any story – any fiction, that is – the amount of blatantly greedy and/or evil shit being pushed out by Trump&rsquo;s administration would see him shut down and tied to a chair by a group of plucky teenagers <i>days</i> ago.</p>
<p>And yet, nothing. He just keeps adding to the pile. Old Man Withers isn&rsquo;t even <i>wearing</i> the swamp monster mask – he doesn&rsquo;t think he needs to, and so far it looks like he&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Nobody listens to the hippies in the van. </p>
<p>And even if they do, they don&rsquo;t (or can&rsquo;t?) <i>do</i> anything.</p>
<p>Trump and his cronies took a look at the board and decided the other side just flat-out doesn&rsquo;t have enough pieces in play to stop one. goddamn. thing. they do.</p>
