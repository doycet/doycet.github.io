<p>I&rsquo;m very lucky to have <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/107391151949970703123" oid="107391151949970703123">Michael Williams</a></span> in my regular Tuesday night (hangouts-based) gaming group. (we&rsquo;re currently playing Dungeon World and Lady Blackbird, after wrapping up a 30-session pbta-hacked Star Wars campaign.)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m lucky to have him because he&rsquo;s a great player. I didn&rsquo;t even KNOW he could draw until he started turning out these wonderful character portraits.</p>
<p>And to be honest, the most enjoyable thing wasn&#39;t the final product (that&#39;s a very close second); it was the long post in our Dungeon World Roll20 forum in which Mike shared each iteration of the work he was doing, and went deep into the design theory behind each character. Fascinating stuff.</p>
