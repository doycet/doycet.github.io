<p>Politics and News stuff is, right now, pretty goddamn painful.</p>
<p>It may not seem like it, but I really do try to balance the doom and gloom stuff with things that, while maybe still newsy, are a little less horrible.</p>
<p>So, here&rsquo;s this piece I just read.</p>
<p><i>I think you can learn a lot from history. “Don’t be complacent” is a good lesson. “Yes, this is really happening” is a good lesson. “Little events can spiral out of control almost in an instant” is a pretty good one, too.</i></p>
<p>Now, don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I&rsquo;m intensely, nauseously worried about where things are are right now, but I do appreciate a realistic take on events that is a <i>little</i> more optimistic about our chances, so I thought I&rsquo;d share. </p>

<p><i>Don’t buy into the inevitability […]. That goes double if you feel like Trump is the end of the world.</i></p>
<p><i>Germany after WW1, Mugabe’s Zimbabwe, Russia during and after the Communist regime — they didn’t have strong civil societies and a strong tradition of government. The United States does. Despite how it may appear at the moment.</i></p>
<p><i>Believing that disaster is inevitable helps allow it to happen. Don’t be blinkered about what a Trump presidency means, but don’t believe that disaster is inevitable.</i></p>
