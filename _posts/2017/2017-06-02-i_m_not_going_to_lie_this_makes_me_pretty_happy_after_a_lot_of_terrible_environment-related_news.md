<p><i>&quot;Americans will honor and fulfill the Paris Agreement by leading from the bottom up &#8211; and there isn&#39;t anything Washington can do to stop us,&quot; Bloomberg said.</i></p>
<p>Actually, let me take that &quot;not going to lie&quot; a bit further: I cried a little when I read this, grateful and a little shocked.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know much about Bloomberg (though I like what I do know); I certainly don&#39;t know if he&#39;s a good person or not.</p>
<p>But the guy just stepped up and promised concrete action to protect my kids, and a ball of tension I didn&#39;t even realize I was holding unwound a little.</p>
