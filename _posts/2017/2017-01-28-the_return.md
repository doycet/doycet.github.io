<p>What we are seeing right now in the United States is the re-colonization of a nation.</p>
<p>The return of <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/09/prison-labor-in-america/406177/" target="_blank"><b>enslavement in the form of mass incarceration and for-profit prisons</b></a>, <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/north-dakota-bill-protects-drivers-from-law-if-they-hit-protesters-in-traffic-2017-1" target="_blank"><b>the legalization</b></a> of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/18/indiana-protest-bill-police-power" target="_blank"><b>murdering protesters</b></a>, the <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2017/01/25/national-parks-employees-are-still-going-rogue-on-twitter.html" target="_blank"><b>criminalization of free speech</b></a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/business/media/journalists-arrested-trump-inauguration.html" target="_blank"><b>criminalization of the press</b></a>, and protest itself.

</p>
<p>Living here means waking up every morning and tasting ashes, knowing it will bring several reminders of your impending dehumanization, destruction, and death. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/josh-rogin/wp/2017/01/26/the-state-departments-entire-senior-management-team-just-resigned/?utm_term=.67c9261461de" target="_blank"><b>Entire departments of our government are resigning.</b></a> Entire departments have been gagged and censored. Entire sections of our society have already been abolished. What I’ve said here already isn’t even close to everything; they are moving quickly in hopes that it will be too fast for anyone to stop it.

<h2>What we are witnessing and being subjected to is the wholesale dismantling of a society.

<blockquote>
<p>The deservedly single biggest issue that gets brought up regarding his term is the minor matter of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Removal_Act" target="_blank">masterminding a genocide</a>. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trail_of_Tears" target="_blank">Trail of Tears</a>
 is one of the largest-scale acts of ethnic cleansing in history, with 
its explicit end the eventual annihilation of the Five Civilized Tribes 
as peoples in the name of “progress.” Jackson brazenly, callously spat 
on treaties that had been established with our erstwhile allies in the 
name of convenient access to cheap land.</p>
<p>Thousands
 died on the death marches. Thousands more died in the concentration 
camps that were their destination. Still more thousands were killed 
because they refused to leave. Soldiers were given direct orders to gun 
down children in cold blood. Natives who fled into the wilderness were 
hunted by civilians for sport.</p>
