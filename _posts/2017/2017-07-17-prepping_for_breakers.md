<p>We&#39;re heading out for a family vacation next week, my niece (13) is coming along, and she wants to do some gaming. (I&#39;ve talked about gaming with Kaylee and her cousins in the past. It&#39;s a thing.)</p>
<p>Anyway, her only request was something &quot;spooky&quot; or suspenseful. Beyond that, &quot;you and Kaylee pick something.&quot;</p>
<p>After some thinking (and considering what I&#39;m going to be willing to pack), I&#39;ve decided on <i>Breakers</i> (which is a hack/upgrade of World of Dungeons, which in turn is a hack of Dungeon World). &#8211; <a href="http://onesevendesign.com/breakers_wodu_turbo.pdf" class="ot-anchor">http://onesevendesign.com/breakers_wodu_turbo.pdf</a></p>
<p><i>The magical realm of Kyvr&#39;ax has collided with Earth, shearing the dimensions and creating a mashed-up borderland between our reality and the monster-infested domain of the wizard Kai Shira Kai. You play working-class heroes who explore the twisted Break seeking fame and fortune. But don&#39;t stay too long, or the Cloud of Woe will surely find you!</i></p>
<p>Basically, it&#39;s an excuse to play modern-day characters dungeon-crawling like it&#39;s an ordinary job. Sort of <i>Torg</i> crossed with <i>Inspectres</i>? Sure. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Anyway, because it&#39;s Monday and I&#39;ve got other stuff I&#39;m <i>supposed</i> to be doing, I decided to come up with a table of Breaker origins/backgrounds. Just in case, you know?</p>
