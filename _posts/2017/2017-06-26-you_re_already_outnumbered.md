<p>My kids are alike in many ways, but they are definitely individuals in ways I&#39;ve tried to articulate in the past.</p>
<p>Yesterday, they gave me a single story that illustrates each of them, perfectly.</p>
<p>We had to drop off Kaylee at camp, and after the paperwork and unpacking in the cabin, everyone was supposed to assemble at &#39;the field&#39; to say goodbyes and play games.</p>
<p>So we went down there, and see about forty kids milling around, visiting, et cetera. There&#39;s a makeshift kickball field, and a couple boys about a year younger than Kaylee, kicking a soccer ball back and forth.</p>
<p>Sean goes over near them, and is watching intently.</p>
<p>One of the kids notices this, and veers off his direction, letting the soccer ball roll over near the edge of the field by the trees and long grass.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you want a ball too?&quot; he asks Sean, extending a old, dirty, yellow rubber ball. &quot;You can have this one. Do you want it?&quot;</p>
<p>He keeps offering it, and asking, over and over, until Sean finally shrugs and reaches for it.</p>
<p>At which point the kid chucks it backwards over his own shoulder and has a good laugh with his buddy.</p>
<p>And here are my kids:</p>
<p>Sean frowns at the kid, shrugs as if to say &quot;whatever man, I don&#39;t even know you, and that ball was gross anyway&quot; and stalks off to do something else.</p>
<p>Kaylee, who&#39;d been standing next to me, takes a couple steps forward and starts in. &quot;Really?!? You&#39;re starting off a week of camp, WITH ME, and the first thing you do is pick on my little brother? THAT seemed like a good idea? Really?!?&quot;</p>
<p>And the boy backs off and rejoins his friend. They both realize they don&#39;t have the soccer ball anymore. It&#39;s over at the edge of the field.</p>
<p>Actually, while all this was going on, Zoe went over and picked it up, and she&#39;s standing right where it had rolled.</p>
<p>They walk over, bending over and talking in that &quot;charm little kids&quot; high voice.</p>
<p>&quot;Hiiiii. Can we have that? Can you give that to us?&quot; They pause. &quot;Do you want to kick it to us?&quot;</p>
<p>Zoe looks at the ball, extends it out toward them&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230; and CHUCKS it back over her shoulder, into the trees and long grass.</p>
<p>Then walks away, without even looking at them.</p>
<p>So&#8230; my kids, in summary:</p>
<p>&#8211; Indifference<br />&#8211; Drama<br />&#8211; REVENGE</p>
