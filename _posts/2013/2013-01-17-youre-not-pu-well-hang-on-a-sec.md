A few days ago, I wrote about the <a href="http://doycetesterman.com/index.php/2013/01/youre-not-punk/" target="_blank">overuse of the -punk additive in the world of publishing</a>. The cyberpunk label lead (tongue in cheek, initially) to steam-punks/steampunk, which started some kind of not-so-tongue-in-cheek avalanche of &#8220;Punk means cool! If our thing is cool, we should add -punk to it to denote our coolness!&#8221;

It was (and still is) my opinion that that overuse &#8220;[dilutes the brand](# "Hi, Tim.")&#8220;, which is a shame.

Unexpectedly, the post hit some kind of vein or nerve or alarm gong for people. Some responded with &#8220;Yes! THIS!&#8221; Some rolled their eyes and muttered &#8220;Overthinking it, dude.&#8221; Fair enough; that happens.

But the most interesting response was related specifically to steampunk, where several readers and writers of same stepped up and said &#8220;Hey! You don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s rebellion against the status-quo in Steampunk? You&#8217;re ignoring all the awesome stories about women rising up out of dismissed second-class status and making a name for themselves.&#8221;

And, again, that&#8217;s fair; I didn&#8217;t _ignore_ those stories, exactly, but they didn&#8217;t ping my radar when I wrote my little screed, because I don&#8217;t see them as the same thing as &#8220;punk rebellion&#8221;. I twooted:

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3740" title="punk detangle" src="http://doycetesterman.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/punk-detangle.png" alt="" width="434" height="211" />](http://doycetesterman.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/punk-detangle.png)

Then:

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3741" title="punk-gender venn" src="http://doycetesterman.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/punk-gender-venn.png" alt="" width="450" height="219" srcset="http://doycetesterman.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/punk-gender-venn-300x146.png 300w, http://doycetesterman.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/punk-gender-venn.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" />](http://doycetesterman.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/punk-gender-venn.png)

Why would I have to be stupid to try such a detangling? Frankly, because I know next to nothing about gender issues in any kind of lit. I&#8217;m not really qualified.

But that&#8217;s never stopped me before! All I need is a little encouragement.

<div id="attachment_3743" style="width: 477px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
  <a href="http://doycetesterman.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/aneki.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-3743" title="aneki" src="http://doycetesterman.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/aneki.png" alt="" width="467" height="167" srcset="http://doycetesterman.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/aneki-300x107.png 300w, http://doycetesterman.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/aneki.png 467w" sizes="(max-width: 467px) 100vw, 467px" /></a>
  
  <p class="wp-caption-text">
    Done!

</div>

So, stepping very carefully, I started noodling this over. I felt, and still feel, that punk-the-way-I-defined-it isn&#8217;t a very strong presence in steampunk novels. That said, I could see people&#8217;s point that there were many, as one reader put it &#8220;uppity wummanz unite!&#8221; stories in there. Not _always_: it&#8217;s obviously not enough to just have a female protagonist &#8212; _Boneshaker_ isn&#8217;t about &#8220;little person against the Institution&#8221;; it&#8217;s a classic &#8220;hero journeys into Hades to retrieve a loved one&#8221; &#8212; but it shows up fairly often.

So that&#8217;s a curious thing. &#8220;Punk nobody against the Establishment&#8221; is a big part of cyberpunk, but not-so-much in steampunk, where &#8220;Smart Woman rises out of Gender Oppression&#8221; is common, instead.

And really, that&#8217;s obvious: both are frontloaded into their respective settings. Cyberpunk is a subset of science fiction for a reason: it&#8217;s usually near-future &#8212; a predictable near-future &#8212; in which corporations have become even more monolithic untouchable things than they already are. &#8220;Little guy uses tech to rise up&#8221; is obvious: tech is one of the arenas in which envision some level of equality, thanks to the early hackers that writers like Gibson heard and read about. Gender issues in a future-us setting aren&#8217;t nearly as easy to find, and in my experience they don&#8217;t find as much traction with readers (in that kind of story) &#8212; we&#8217;d like to imagine ourselves having evolved past _that_, at least, even if we&#8217;re stuck in some dystopian future, ground down under a corpocracy.

Which isn&#8217;t to say gender inequality issues aren&#8217;t relevant and important and a thing worth thinking and talking about: they are. Enter steampunk which, due to its sort of hazy, hand-wavey &#8220;era&#8221;, pretty much gives us gender bias as an issue by default. It&#8217;s a good match.

So, finally, that Venn diagram, rendered with my undeniable Paint skills:

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3742" title="punk vs gender venn diagram" src="http://doycetesterman.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/punk-vs-gender-venn-diagram.jpg" alt="" width="457" height="380" srcset="http://doycetesterman.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/punk-vs-gender-venn-diagram-300x249.jpg 300w, http://doycetesterman.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/punk-vs-gender-venn-diagram.jpg 457w" sizes="(max-width: 457px) 100vw, 457px" />](http://doycetesterman.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/punk-vs-gender-venn-diagram.jpg)

So, in this somewhat obvious breakdown, the difference between the two kinds of stories lie in the character&#8217;s motivation, and the big overlap is in the resulting action: rebellion. Simplistic? Sure. Maybe even way off base, but that&#8217;s the spot I got to in my couple-three days of thinking about it.

And maybe that opens up the discussion of all &#8216;-punk&#8217; stories, a little bit. If you solve for the common denominator in all this, you get &#8220;Someone representing a significant portion of the population (and someone we can identify with) uses the [tech] of the setting to upset the apple cart in some way. Flavor as appropriate to sub-genre, bake, and serve.&#8221;

I can accept that. That&#8217;s a reasonable way to (re)define the &#8220;-punk&#8221; umbrella.

**That still doesn&#8217;t mean the term isn&#8217;t wildly overused**, and often laughably inaccurate (see my The City & The City example from the last post). That is still a problem, and it&#8217;s really what I was ranting about in the first place.

But if you hand me a book and say &#8220;this is steampunk&#8221; or &#8220;this is dieselpunk&#8221;, I&#8217;m not going to dismiss it out of hand; I&#8217;m going to look (full of hope) for a certain kind of story.

Because it&#8217;s really awesome when it&#8217;s there.
