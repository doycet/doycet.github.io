Hey all.

I know there's a fair bit of love for <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/109520895039402955734" oid="109520895039402955734">Andrew Medeiros</a></span>'s Star Wars World around here, so (prompted by <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/103667855585775066713" oid="103667855585775066713">Aaron Griffin</a></span>?) I thought I'd share a hack of that hack &#8211; _Star Wars World: Rebel Ops_.

The really short version of the changes from SWW is:  
* Slightly tougher characters/less brutal combat.  
* Different Force mechanics, mostly related to Corruption/Dark Side stuff and how that's handled by the players and GM.  
* 66% fewer Jedi playbooks, to match the era/scope.  
* Three new playbooks: The Droid, The Partisan, and the Slicer.  
* Changes to pretty much every other playbook, except (for some reason) Gearhead.

There's a longer changelog thing on the front page.

Anyway: my group switched from FAE and have been playing with this for a couple weeks now, and it's going well, so I thought I'd share the fruits of many late-night editing sessions.
