My agent just sent over the submission list for ADRIFT (editors/publishers we're sending the manuscript to next week). It's pretty much "all of them."

And I have to tell you guys&#8230;

I mean, first: probably nothing comes of it.

Yeah, the book's good &#8211; I know that &#8211; but it's a big weird sci-fi fairy tale THING clocking in around 150 thousand words, with sequels pretty much baked in to the DNA. The mainstream market for that is ROUGH.

But that doesn't _matter_. Because I'm looking at long list of names. I'm looking at my agent's PLAN.

Goddamn I can't explain how nice that feels.

Anyway. Clearly defined, BIG next step forward; one that will soon (well&#8230; "soon" for publishing, which mean 'inside 4 months') tell me what the NEXT step will be. One way or the other, I'm going to have a lot to do in 2017.

Pretty good day.
