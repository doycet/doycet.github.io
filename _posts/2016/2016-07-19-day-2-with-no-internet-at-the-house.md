Found the two-year-old knapping a flint knife in the back yard. 

Where did she get the flint? 

How did she know how to knapp the stone without a YouTube tutorial? 

She wouldn't answer my questions. Whispered "What do you want to do today, Ferb?", turned away, and vaulted over the neighbor's fence.
