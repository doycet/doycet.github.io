I love it, but as much as anything else I love the conversations it opens up with <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/115858100139664016432" oid="115858100139664016432">Kaylee Testerman</a></span> about the nature of relationships and what that word even _means_ &#8211; what our assumptions are and how they're different for different people. _SU_ isn't (solely) about that conversation, but it provides the best possible medium for it.

And aside from all that, it's about emotions and growing up and learning how to deal with all that messy stuff. One of last night's episodes choked me up, and gave me a really good thing to talk about with our very own Ruby (<span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/109551309409185031486" oid="109551309409185031486">Sean Testerman</a></span>).

So&#8230; where was I going with this? Hell of a smart, funny, lovely show, and quite often just the thing we need, right when we need it, even when we didn't know we did.

Rebecca Sugar, creator of Steven Universe, spoke with us about her new book, attitudes toward LGBTQ themes in children&#8217;s media and her personal history with fairy tales.
