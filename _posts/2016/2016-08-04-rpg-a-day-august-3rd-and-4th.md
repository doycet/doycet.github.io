**_August 3_** _What is something you have done with your game character that you are the proudest of?_

I really don't get to play very much, so I don't have a long list of these kinds of examples. I never really been a player in a long campaign &#8211; I just run them. ðŸ˜›

Back in the heyday of DnD 3.0 and 3.5, I participated in all the local gaming conventions, especially the "Living" campaigns, since that let me actually, you know, play. My main guy in the Living Greyhawk campaign was Gwydion, a kilt-wearing skald (couple-three levels of barbarian, the rest bard). He was a ton of fun to play, and managed to pull off some pretty great tricks (detonating an entire necklace of fireballs, with only four hit points at the time, and surviving &#8211; probably tops the list).

I was especially happy when, at around level nine, events in the campaign and the path I'd taken Gwydion let him move into the "Spy" prestige class as he became an agent of the Crown of Furyondy. That was pretty cool.

I played him again, about a year later: older, grizzled, married, with a missing hand, and managed to berserk and pull off a 'trip' maneuver against a young black dragon, leaving the big bastard prone for the group's rogue to take apart. People still talk about that one.

Gwydion's probably the guy I wish I could play more.

**_August 4:_** _What is the most impressive thing that you can remember another player&rsquo;s character doing in a session?_

The first thing to come to mind is <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/103328827291075446110" oid="103328827291075446110">Margie Kleerup</a></span> in our Star Wars game, fairly recently, driving a landspeeder across the backs of a herd of stampeding bantha as they thundered down a narrow canyon.

That, and probably <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/102490474608993969903" oid="102490474608993969903">Kate Testerman</a></span>'s character from our short _Don't Rest Your Head_ game, making paradox-level time travel totally work in an awesome way.

**_August 5:_** _What story does your group still tell about your character?_

As mentioned already, probably the time I successfully did a grapple/trip attack against a black dragon. He was only one size category bigger than my guy (Large), and not TOO strong, so with Berserk on (I was playing a Barbarian/Bard multiclass), I think I just needed to beat the GM's roll by&#8230; eight or something.

Basically, I had to roll reasonably well and he had to roll poorly, and that's pretty much what happened. <img src="http://randomaverage.com/wp/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
