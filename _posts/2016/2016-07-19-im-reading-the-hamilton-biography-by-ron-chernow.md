It's interesting &#8211; a great read &#8211; but one of the most fascinating / horrifying things throughout the book is politicians and people in powerful government office have literally **always** been blinkered assholes since the very founding of the country. (And before that, pretty much forever, but whatever.)

Ninety percent of the stuff the book talks about during Adams' presidency could be taken from newspapers today.

Right down to plagiarizing sections of speeches from a member of the opposite party and getting called on it. (Which I read about yesterday in the book, then again this morning, regarding the RNC.)

Fox News? They had that. HuffPost? They had that too.

The point is, there has never been a point in our grand republican experiment when our leaders weren't aggrandizing shitlords painting crude caricatures of the opposition party with their own blood and feces.

**So proud.**

There's a section of the book I just got through &#8212; this would have been while Hamilton was Inspector General of the provisional army during the Adams administration, where a Federalist congressman _spat in the face_ of a Republican, was then 'thrashed with an oak cane' by said Republican, and then picked up **FIREPLACE TONGS** to finish the brawl with the guy&#8230; in the middle of the House floor.

This would have been&#8230; 10, maybe eleven years into the constitutional government? What a sound foundation of glory our country is built upon.

And the baseless accusations and hype. Oh my word.

"Our president is working in secret to bring us back under George III!"

"President&#8230; Washington?"

"YES."

"The commander in chief of the entire Revolutionary Army? THAT Washington?"

**"YES."**

"Here's 45 facts, with citations, listing why that is batshit insane."

"Blah blah blah can't hear you MONARCHIST ANGLOMAN."

So&#8230; yeah. At least the opposition bullshit with Obama/Climate Change/AHCA has historical precedent?

Apparently facts have always gotten in the way of "proper politics."
