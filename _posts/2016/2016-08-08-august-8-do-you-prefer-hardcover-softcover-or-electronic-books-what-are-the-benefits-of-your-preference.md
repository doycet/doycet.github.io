I like ebook versions of RPG texts, which are unfortunately as rare as hen's teeth. PDF is&#8230; fine. Not great. Pretty much unreadable on small screens (I sometimes have my phone's pdf viewer read them aloud while I drive, which is &#8230; differently sub-optimal), while larger screens are less easy to carry around.

Paper books are the clear winner for any book I plan to reference a lot in play, because it's still too difficult to flip to another part of a text while 'holding your finger' somewhere else in the book.

**Bonus Content:** I wrote about how to make e-readers suck less as reference tools three and a half years ago, with pictures &#8211; <http://doycetesterman.com/index.php/2013/01/e-readers-suck-for-reference-materials-but-they-dont-have-to/>

On the other hand, if I'm just **reading** something, electronic is fine.

I just wish we could get away from PDFs and more toward ebook formats.
