One of the&#8230; I'm going to say _"dependencies for enjoyment"_ in many &#8211; I might even say "most" RPGs I've run (or run into) in the last few years is a deep knowledge of the genre &#8212; not just the genre for the setting, but the _RPG_ genre of the game in question.

So&#8230; like this: once upon a time, all you really needed to know when starting to play D&D was "there's magic, no guns, and weird monsters." Same was true, basically, for _Traveller_ or whatever.

Maybe that's still true for 5e versions of those games. Probably is. Anyway.

But there are a WHOLE BUNCH of games/settings out there now that drop a **tremendous** amount of signal when trying to reach a new gamer, because that new gamer doesn't have the decades of previous gaming exposure that informs the game designer's decisions for a game.

_Dungeon World_, for example, is fun, and it works with new players, but it doesn't work as well &#8211; there just isn't as much _there_ &#8211; for the gamer who never played the old versions of D&D DW is reflecting. Ditto Black Hack or whatever.

Same thing is true for genre mashups: Steampunk Planetary Romance isn't _inherently_ cool or interesting as a concept if the person you're sharing it with isn't familiar with the "pure" components of that salad, you know? It's just weird sci-fi with wood ships and a lot of brass and goggles. It might work for the player, but it won't work for the intended/expected reasons.

_Masters of Umdaar_ is <del>phenomenally boring</del> not especially compelling if you didn't grow up on the right cartoons, you know?

I run into this constantly when playing with my kids &#8211; lots of stuff I find interesting/entertaining&#8230; until I realize that for all intents and purposes, my kids just don't **Get the Joke.**

First, I need to run the original games everyone's ironically riffing off of, before we can get to the new stuff, or it's not a nuanced re-envisioning for them. It's just&#8230; weird and kind of confusing.

When I run a game that doesn't have that problem, it's almost always something only trying to be _itself_.
