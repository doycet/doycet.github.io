**August 6: What is the most amazing thing that you know a game group has done for their community?**

**August 7: What aspect of Roleplaying Games has had the biggest effect on you?**

I've been gaming for so long, and it's impacted so much of my life, it's kind of difficult to sort out what's related to or impacted by gaming, and what isn't. Here's a few things I know would not be the same with me, were it not for gaming.

* My ability to speak to and lead group discussions/classes, and manage small group dynamics.  
* My writing, both in terms of subject matter and sheer volume of practice.  
* My circle of friends and acquaintances.  
* I would never have met my wife and, by extension, wouldn't have met my kids.

Day to day, though? I suppose it's the fact I can't watch a TV show, see a movie, or read a book without considering how it would work as a game. I don't know if that's a benefit or not, but it's definitely an "always on" feature of my life as a gamer.
