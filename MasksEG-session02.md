# Session 02 - Non-Frolick

We're two weeks into the school year and things are not going great for the team. Silhouette gets rocked by some disapproving teachers, AEGIS assigns a babysitter to Palacine, and Ember melts down in the cafeteria. (Not literally.)

The team then faces off against Honor Roll in a "save the hostage" scenario that goes a bit sideways, and get get a hint of badness to come.
