<p>Doyce Testerman was born and raised in the wilds of South Dakota, where he developed an early and lifelong love affair with the written word, especially stories that included a bit more magic, mayhem, or mystery than one typically finds around a large Midwestern farm. He moved to Denver in 1995, where he has steadily ceded control of his weekends to his dogs, his brilliant wife, and three astounding children.

<p>Yes, that’s his real name.

<p>He has been a professional writer for over a decade. His work has appeared in a number of online magazines and anthologies related to pen-and-paper roleplaying games, computer games, erotica, and genre fiction. His contemporary fantasy novel Hidden Things was published by HarperCollins in 2012, followed by a personally narrated Hidden Things audiobook in 2014, and the short story collection _Little Things_ in 2015. He’s currently working on a science fiction novel he describes as ‘Blade Runner meets Big Fish.’ He is represented by the <a href="http://www.bgliterary.com/" target="_blank">Barry Goldblatt Literary Agency</a>.
